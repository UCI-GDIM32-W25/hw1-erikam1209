## Prof comments
You included your in-class activity notes, but your Devlog is missing! :(

Also, please consider formatting your break-down activities with the hyphen '-' symbol as suggested above, and make sure your in-class activity is under the right section. This will make it a lot easier for me to read. See the [README formatting guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

I fixed the formatting and moved your in-class activity to the right spot, but I wasn't able to find your Devlog.
